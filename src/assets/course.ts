      title: 'What is JavaScript?',
      content:
        "JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It was originally designed as a scripting language for websites but has evolved into a fully-fledged programming language used for both client-side and server-side development. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. It's multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. Despite its name, JavaScript is not related to Java.",
    },
    {
      title: 'Brief History of JavaScript',
      content:
        'JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications. It was initially called Mocha, then changed to LiveScript, and finally to JavaScript. The language was standardized in 1997 as ECMAScript. Since then, it has undergone numerous updates and improvements. Major milestones include the release of ECMAScript 3 in 1999, ECMAScript 5 in 2009, and ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) in 2015, which introduced significant new features. Subsequent yearly releases have continued to enhance the language.',
    },
    {
      title: 'JavaScript in Web Development',
      content:
        "JavaScript plays a crucial role in modern web development. It's one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. While HTML structures the content and CSS styles it, JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It can update content in real-time, control multimedia, animate images, and much more. With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript has also become popular for server-side programming, allowing developers to use a single language across the full stack.",
    },
    {
      title: 'Setting Up JavaScript Environment',
      content:
        "One of the advantages of JavaScript is its low barrier to entry. To start coding in JavaScript, all you need is a web browser and a text editor. Modern web browsers have built-in JavaScript engines and developer tools that allow you to run and debug JavaScript code. For more advanced development, you might use integrated development environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio Code, WebStorm, or Atom. For server-side JavaScript, you'll need to install Node.js on your computer. Version control systems like Git are also commonly used in JavaScript development.",
    },
    {
      title: 'JavaScript Syntax Basics',
      content:
        "JavaScript syntax is the set of rules that define how JavaScript programs are constructed. It's designed to be easy to read and write. JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. Statements in JavaScript are separated by semicolons (though they're often optional due to automatic semicolon insertion). Whitespace is generally ignored. Comments can be single-line (//) or multi-line (/* */). JavaScript supports both object-oriented programming with prototypal inheritance and functional programming styles.",
    },
    {
      title: 'Variables and Data Types',
      content:
        "Variables in JavaScript are declared using let, const, or var keywords. let and const were introduced in ES6 and are block-scoped, while var is function-scoped. const is used for variables whose values won't be reassigned. JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning variables can hold values of any type. The primary data types in JavaScript are: Number (for both integers and floating-point), String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol (added in ES6), and BigInt (added in ES2020). JavaScript also has a complex data type: Object, which includes arrays, functions, and dates.",
    },
    {
      title: 'Operators in JavaScript',
      content:
        'JavaScript supports various types of operators. Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %, **) perform mathematical operations. Comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=) compare values and return a boolean. Logical operators (&&, ||, !) perform logical operations. Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=) assign values to variables. The ternary operator (?:) provides a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement. There are also bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>) for performing bitwise operations on binary representations of numbers.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Control Flow: Conditional Statements',
      content:
        "Conditional statements in JavaScript allow you to execute different blocks of code based on different conditions. The if statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. It can be followed by an optional else clause to execute a block of code when the condition is false. Multiple conditions can be checked using else if. The switch statement can be used when you have multiple conditions to check against a single value. It's often more readable than multiple if-else statements when dealing with many conditions.",
    },
    {
      title: 'Control Flow: Loops',
      content:
        "Loops in JavaScript are used to execute a block of code multiple times. The for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. It's often used when you know in advance how many times the loop should run. The while loop repeats as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. It's useful when you don't know in advance how many times the loop should run. The do...while loop is similar to the while loop, except that it always executes the code block at least once before checking the condition. The for...of loop (introduced in ES6) is used to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings, etc.",
    },
    {
      title: 'Functions in JavaScript',
      content:
        'Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a particular task. Functions are defined using the function keyword, followed by a name, a list of parameters in parentheses, and the function body enclosed in curly braces. Functions can take parameters (arguments) and can return a value using the return statement. JavaScript also supports function expressions and arrow functions (introduced in ES6). Functions in JavaScript are first-class objects, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Scope and Closures',
      content:
        'Scope in JavaScript refers to the current context of code, which determines the accessibility of variables to JavaScript. The two main types of scope are global and local. Variables declared outside of any function have global scope, while those declared inside a function have local scope. Block-scoped variables (let and const) are restricted to the block they are declared in. Closures are a powerful feature in JavaScript. A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. It allows a function to access variables from an outer function even after the outer function has returned.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Arrays and Array Methods',
      content:
        'Arrays in JavaScript are high-level, list-like objects used to store multiple values in a single variable. They can contain elements of different types, including other arrays (creating multi-dimensional arrays). Arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0. JavaScript provides numerous built-in methods to manipulate arrays. Some common methods include push() and pop() for adding/removing elements from the end, shift() and unshift() for the beginning, slice() for extracting a portion of an array, splice() for adding/removing elements at a specific position, and forEach(), map(), filter(), and reduce() for iterating and transforming arrays.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Objects and Object-Oriented Programming',
      content:
        "Objects in JavaScript are complex data types that allow you to store collections of data and functionality together. They consist of properties (key-value pairs) and methods (functions associated with the object). Objects can be created using object literals, constructor functions, or the class syntax introduced in ES6. JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance, where objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects. The class syntax in ES6 provides a more familiar way to create objects and implement inheritance for developers coming from class-based languages, although it's essentially syntactic sugar over JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance.",
    },
    {
      title: 'Error Handling in JavaScript',
      content:
        'Error handling in JavaScript is crucial for creating robust applications. The try...catch statement is used to handle exceptions (runtime errors). Code that might throw an error is placed in the try block, and the code to handle the error is placed in the catch block. An optional finally block can be added to execute code regardless of whether an error occurred. JavaScript has several built-in error types like SyntaxError, TypeError, ReferenceError, etc. You can also create custom error types by extending the Error object. The throw statement is used to generate custom errors. Proper error handling helps in debugging and creating user-friendly error messages.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Asynchronous JavaScript',
      content:
        "Asynchronous programming is a crucial concept in JavaScript, especially for operations that may take some time to complete (like API calls or file operations). Traditionally, callbacks were used to handle asynchronous operations, but they could lead to complex, hard-to-read code (often called 'callback hell'). Promises, introduced in ES6, provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations. A Promise represents a value that may not be available yet but will be resolved at some point in the future. The async/await syntax, introduced in ES2017, builds on top of Promises and allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code, making it even easier to reason about.",

      title: 'What is a String in JavaScript?',
      content: `In JavaScript, a string is a sequence of characters used to represent text. Strings are primitive data types and immutable, meaning once a string is created, its contents cannot be changed. Strings can be created using single quotes (''), double quotes (""), or backticks (\`\`). The backticks allow for template literals, which can embed expressions.`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Creating Strings',
      content:
        "There are multiple ways to create strings in JavaScript. You can use string literals with single or double quotes: let str1 = 'Hello'; let str2 = \"World\"; Or use the String constructor function: let str3 = String('JavaScript'); Template literals (backticks) allow for multi-line strings and expression interpolation: let name = 'Alice'; let greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;",

      title: 'String Length',
      content:
        "The length property of a string returns the number of characters in the string. For example: let str = 'Hello'; console.log(str.length); // Outputs: 5. Note that length is a property, not a method, so it's accessed without parentheses.",
    },
    {
      title: 'Accessing Characters in a String',
      content:
        "Individual characters in a string can be accessed using bracket notation with the index of the character (zero-based). For example: let str = 'Hello'; console.log(str[0]); // Outputs: 'H'. You can also use the charAt() method: console.log(str.charAt(1)); // Outputs: 'e'.",
    },
    {
      title: 'String Immutability',
      content:
        "Strings in JavaScript are immutable, which means you cannot change individual characters of a string. Operations that appear to modify a string actually create a new string. For example: let str = 'Hello'; str[0] = 'J'; // This doesn't work console.log(str); // Still outputs: 'Hello'",
    },
    {
      title: 'String Concatenation',
      content:
